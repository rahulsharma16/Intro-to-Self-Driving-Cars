# Computer Vision
This chapter project classifies traffic lights (red, blue and green) by converting it into HSV colorspace, masking, and extracting a brightness feature. Used OpenCV, 1500 total images divided into 80% training and 20% testing.

Implemented code in [Traffic_Light_Classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/7.Computer%20Vision/Traffic_Light_Classifier.ipynb).
