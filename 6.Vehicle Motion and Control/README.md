This chapter project extracts trajectory from sensor data through odometry, accelerometers and rate gyros.

Implemented code in [Reconstructing Trajectories.ipynb](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/6.Vehicle%20Motion%20and%20Control/Reconstructing%20Trajectories.ipynb).
