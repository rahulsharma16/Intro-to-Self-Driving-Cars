# Performance Programming in C++
This chapter mainly focuses on optimizing code in C++ (dead code, static, variables by reference and reserving space) and finally optimizing the previous C++ histogram code.

Implemented code in \*\_improved files (blur, normalize, sense etc.) and tested it by measuring running time in main.cpp.
