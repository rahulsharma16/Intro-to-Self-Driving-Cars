# Performance Programming in C++
This chapter mainly focuses on optimizing code in C++ (dead code, static, variables by reference and reserving space) and finally optimizing the previous C++ histogram code.

Implemented code in \*\_improved files ([blur](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/4.Performance%20Programming/optimized_code/blur_improved.cpp), [normalize](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/4.Performance%20Programming/optimized_code/normalize_improved.cpp), [move](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/4.Performance%20Programming/optimized_code/move_improved.cpp), [sense](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/4.Performance%20Programming/optimized_code/sense_improved.cpp) etc.) and tested it by measuring running time in [main.cpp](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/4.Performance%20Programming/optimized_code/main.cpp).
