# Working With Matrices
This chapter progresses through learning more on matrices, Kalman Filters and finally implementing a Matrix Class project on Python.

Implemented code in matrix.py and tested it through [matrix_playground.ipynb](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/2.Matrices/matrix_playground.ipynb)
