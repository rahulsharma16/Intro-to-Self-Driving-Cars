# C++ Basics
This chapter mainly focuses on learning C++, OOPS and finally translating the Python Class to C++ using vectors.

Implemented code in [helpers.cpp](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/3.C%2B%2B%20Basics/helpers.cpp) and [localizer.cpp](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/3.C%2B%2B%20Basics/localizer.cpp) and run [simulate.cpp](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/3.C%2B%2B%20Basics/simulate.cpp).
