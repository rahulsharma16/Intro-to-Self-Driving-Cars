# Navigating Data Structures
This chapter discusses basic data structures in Python (lists, sets and dictionaries), route planning algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Best-First Search and A\*) and finally implements them to code A\* algorithm.

Implemented code in [project_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/5.Route%20Planner/project_notebook.ipynb) and tested it through tests in [test.py](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/5.Route%20Planner/test.py).
