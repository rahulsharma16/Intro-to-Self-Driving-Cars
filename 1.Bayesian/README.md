# Bayesian Learning
Bayesian Learning denotes probability distribution localization calculated from Bayes' Rule.

Two of the major assignments/projects completed here were:
1. Histogram Filter
- Implement sense and move functions in [simulate.py](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/1.Bayesian/Histogram%20Filter/simulate.py)
- Code exploration and debugging in [writeup.ipynb](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/1.Bayesian/Histogram%20Filter/writeup.ipynb)

2. Joy Ride - [Parallel Parking](https://github.com/rahulsharma16/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/1.Bayesian/Joy%20Ride%20-%20Parallel%20Parking/ParallelParking.ipynb) 
- Parallel Parking using car parameters throttle, brake and steer
- Divide workspace in different times and y_position
- Tuned values manually
